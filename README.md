🔠 Hangman — Python Project

A modular, text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game built using Python.
This project features ASCII art for each stage, a multi-life system, and a separate word list module for clean structure.
Developed as part of my #90DaysOfCode challenge to strengthen logic, modular design, and user interaction.

🎮 How the Game Works

The program randomly selects a word from a curated word list.
The player starts with 6 lives.
Each incorrect guess reduces a life and updates the ASCII hangman stage.
Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
The game ends when:
✅ The player guesses all letters → You win!
❌ Lives reach zero → Game Over.
